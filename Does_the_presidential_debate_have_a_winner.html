        <h2><strong>Does the presidential debate have a winner 2024 election results libertarian party</strong></h2>
        <p>From transgender student rights to &lsquo;woke&rsquo; curriculum, Harris and <b>Trump</b> offer two starkly different views on the federal government&rsquo;s role in education.  <b>Harris</b>: <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Harris comes from an administration with a shifting record on immigration. At first, Biden relaxed rules. He undid many of Trump&rsquo;s policies and spoke warmly about...  For months, polling showed the issue was a weak spot for <b>Harris</b>. <b>Trump</b> has labeled <b>Harris</b> as the &ldquo;border czar,&rdquo; trying to blame her for the country&rsquo;s <b>immigration</b> challenges and overstating ...  Republicans have repeatedly hammered President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala <b>Harris</b> on the issue and painted a picture of an out-of-control <b>immigration</b> system where migrants are straining services as would-be terrorists and criminals take advantage of the chaos to infiltrate the country.  On the campaign trail, Vice President Kamala <b>Harris</b> and former President <b>Trump</b> have clashed over how to handle <b>immigration</b> policy. Lisa Desjardins takes a look at both candidates&#39; plans.  Maggie Astor, a politics reporter for The New York Times, breaks down where former President Donald <b>Trump</b> and Vice President Kamala <b>Harris</b> stand on <b>immigration</b>.  Trump supporters express far higher levels of concern than Harris supporters about illegal <b>immigration</b>. Most Trump supporters (87%) say they are very or extremely concerned about the number of immigrants entering the country illegally, while about a quarter of Harris supporters (27%) say the same.  The video comes on the heels of two <b>Trump</b> campaign ads taking direct aim at <b>Harris</b>&rsquo; <b>immigration</b> portfolio. Both <b>Trump</b> campaign ads, released this week, pull from a 2021 NBC interview where ...  <b>Immigration</b> is a top presidential election issue again in 2024, as Republican Donald <b>Trump</b> and Democrat Kamala <b>Harris</b> espouse starkly different approaches to managing the border. </p>        <p><a href="./973.html">Ivanka trump x</a>.
