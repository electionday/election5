        <p>The <b>Simpsons</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>predict</b> Trump&#39;<b>s</b> <b>assassination</b> attempt. Viral posts falsely claimed The Simpsons featured Trump in a coffin. The former president only appeared in 3 regular episodes (plus a few specials), never in any predicted assassination scenario.  When does Trump die in &#39;The <b>Simpsons</b>&#39;? An image that looked like it had been plucked straight out of a Simpsons episode began making the rounds in 2017, and shows the 45th president of the United States lying in a coffin with what appears to be a Secret Service agent standing in front of him.

The episode, &ldquo;<b>Lisa</b> the...  Social media was abuzz with theories that the US sitcom, The <b>Simpsons</b>, predicted the assassination attempt on Trump. The animated show, which has been credited with many accidental predictions, had reportedly portrayed Trump in a coffin.  &ldquo;The <b>Simpsons</b>&rdquo; did not predict that former U.S. President Donald Trump would die in 2024.

The...  Channel 4 has pulled an episode of The <b>Simpsons </b>in the aftermath of the gun attack at a Donald <b>Trump </b>rally in Pennsylvania.  While in The <b>Simpsons</b>, the unnamed president was arrested for murder, last year Trump <b>was</b> arrested and charged in an election subversion case.
