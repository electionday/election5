        <p>What Does the Constitution State About Election <b>Day</b>? The Constitution allows states to choose the &ldquo;Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,&rdquo; but permits Congress to &ldquo;make or alter&rdquo; those state rules &ldquo;except  Americans first began the custom of weekday voting in 1845, when Congress passed a federal law designating the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November as <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>.  The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the <b>Day</b> on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.  The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the <b>Day</b> on which they shall give their Votes; which <b>Day</b> shall be the same throughout the United States.  <b>On</b> <b>Nov</b>. <b>5</b>, <b>2024</b>, voters will head to the polls in person to select the next president and vice president of the United States, as well as members of the 119th Congress. How that process is conducted, and the Constitution&rsquo;s role in setting the guidelines for elections, has changed greatly over time.  <b>The</b> <b>Elections</b> <b>Clause</b> gives the states and the federal government concurrent jurisdiction over congressional elections, granting states the power to set the &ldquo;Times, Places, and Manner&rdquo; of these elections, and delegating to Congress the authority to &ldquo;alter&rdquo; state regulations or &ldquo;make&rdquo; its own.  <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> in the United States is the annual <b>day</b> for general <b>elections</b> of federal, state and local public officials. With respect to federal <b>elections</b>, it is statutorily set by the U.S. government as &quot;the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November&quot; [ 1 ] of even-numbered years (i.e., the Tuesday that occurs within November 2 to November 8).  <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> for federal offices is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years. <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> falls between November 2 and November 8, depending on the calendar. Upcoming <b>elections</b> are scheduled for November 5, 2024, and November 3, 2026. What Does the <b>Constitution</b> Say About <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>?  Section 4 Congress. The Times, Places and Manner of holding <b>Elections</b> for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. </p>        <p>Who won the presidential debate tonight trump or biden.
