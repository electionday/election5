        <h2><strong>Trump favorite book Trump kamala election map</strong></h2>
        <p>It was a go-to line during her 2020 presidential primary campaign and into the general election as Biden&rsquo;s running mate: &ldquo;What <b>can</b> <b>be</b>, <b>unburdened</b> by what <b>has</b> been.&rdquo;  On Sunday night, Trump&#39;s campaign posted on X with a link to <b>Harris</b>&#39; account rebrand, mocking a memed line from one of her speeches: &quot;This account is living <b>unburdened</b> by what has been.&quot; Harris...  The RNC compiled a supercut of <b>Harris</b> being &quot;<b>unburdened</b>&quot; and shared it on social media, arguing that it shows she is &ldquo;unoriginal, annoying, and highly incompetent.&rdquo;  PROFILE: A phrase often repeated by Kamala Harris &mdash; &lsquo;<b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b>, unburdened by what has been&rsquo; &mdash; has become a rallying cry as she becomes the presumptive nominee, write Richard Hall ...  Is &quot;<b>unburdened</b> <b>by what has</b> <b>been</b>,&quot; part of a phrase often used by Vice President <b>Kamala</b> <b>Harris</b>, drawn from a quote by philosopher Karl Marx? No, that&#39;s not true: There is no evidence that Marx publicly made such a statement in his lifetime. <b>Harris</b> <b>has</b> not credited Marx with the phrase.  Tonight I reflect on their struggle, their determination, and the strength of their vision to see what can be, <b>unburdened</b> <b>by what has</b> <b>been</b>. And I stand on their shoulders.  &quot;<b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b>, unburdened by what has been&quot; has become an ironic phrase which supporters of Kamala Harris use to signal their allegiance to her. Similar to &quot;You think you just fell out of a coconut tree,&quot; the phrase is appealing because it feels a little out of left field.  And it is with this understanding, this vision to see what can be <b>unburdened</b> by what <b>has</b> <b>been</b>, that Rev has dedicated his life to building that coalition, from Washington, D.C., to California...  In December and again in June, the RNC and Trump campaign shared video compilations of a common <b>refrain</b>&mdash;&ldquo;<b>unburdened</b> <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b>&rdquo;&mdash;<b>that</b> Harris has repeated in official speeches and... </p>        <p>Election results yavapai.
