        <h2><strong>Trump force one toy Presidential debate questions that were asked</strong></h2>
        <p>Feel free to pray as you remember, to set an alarm each hour or find a way that works for you to engage prayerfully on <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>. What follows is simply a guide, allowing you to focus your thoughts and prayers throughout the day.  Endow my spirit with Your mercy. This <b>day</b>, dear Lord, I also join the Communion of Saints in my <b>prayers</b> for the United States (my nation). May Your will and Your will alone be done in our <b>elections</b>. May You and You alone guide the legislators and those with executive office. May Your Truth and Your Truth alone guide our judges.  Today is <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> in the United States. As millions of Americans head to the polls, let us also take time to pray. Several prominent Catholic leaders and organizations have taken to social media to share <b>prayer</b> initiatives nationwide. 1) EWTN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Novena to the Mother of God for the Nation&ldquo;  <b>Prayer</b> is one of the most important actions during an <b>election</b>, next to voting. Let&#39;s speak these 8 election prayer <b>points</b> over our voting decision, the candidates, and our nation.  A Prayer for our Nation&#39;s Election. O <b>God</b>, we acknowledge <b>You</b> today as Lord, Not only of individuals, but of nations and governments. We thank You for the privilege. Of being able to organize ourselves politically. And of knowing that political loyalty. Does not have to mean disloyalty to You.  Prayer can call for <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> <b>justice</b> in the <b>electoral</b> process, including voter access, transparency in counting votes, and the integrity of the <b>election</b> system. It&#39;s also important to pray for our leaders in government to pursue laws that protect and serve those who have no voice.  A <b>prayer</b> for the act of voting and the <b>election</b> outcome. Almighty God, prepare our hearts and minds as we head toward voting. We express gratitude for the right to vote, and we lament the ...  <b>During</b> <b>election</b> periods, it is essential to pray for <b>election</b> officials who bear the responsibility of ensuring a fair and transparent process. Together, we can pray for God to grant them wisdom, patience, and integrity as they navigate the complexities of vote counting and result verification. Additionally, pray for peace and understanding ...  May the hearts of our elected leaders be humbled, that they would fear You, Lord, above all and seek You in prayer and in scripture to know how to handle the important issues of our day. <b>Psalm</b> <b>2:10</b>-<b>11</b>, Proverbs 11:14, 1 Timothy 2:1-5; 8.
