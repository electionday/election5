        <p><b>Polls</b> were <b>historically</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>in</b> <b>2021</b>-<b>22</b>. Weighted-average error of polls in the final 21 days* before presidential primary and presidential, Senate, House and gubernatorial general...  Harris needs 44 of these battleground electoral votes to win the <b>election</b>, assuming both candidates win all of the states where <b>polls</b> show them with significant leads. Trump needs 51 .  The AP also declared winners as <b>poll</b> closed in earlier states, as well as in some races for U.S. Senate and governor. The AP considers multiple factors and analyzes available data before determining whether a winner can be declared when <b>polls</b> close in a given state. But the AP will never declare the outcome in a competitive contest before ...  <b>538</b>&rsquo;<b>s</b> pollster ratings are calculated by analyzing the historical accuracy and methodological transparency of each polling organization&rsquo;s polls. We define accuracy as the average adjusted...  However, while the polls that year were dramatically wrong, most <b>polling</b> throughout the 2020 <b>election</b> cycle correctly predicted that Joe Biden would defeat Trump.  To judge the <b>accuracy</b> of presidential <b>polls</b>, the charts in this article show averages that combine many polls into one estimate for each election.  If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with a pollster, you can see how they&rsquo;ve been rated by third-party groups such as the polling website FiveThirtyEight, which has a list of pollster ratings based on their...  But <b>elections</b> are just one of many topics that <b>polls</b> are used to understand. A new analysis from <b>Pew Research Center</b> examines the <b>accuracy</b> of polling on more than 20 topics, ranging from Americans&rsquo; employment and vaccination status to whether they&rsquo;ve served in the military or experienced financial hardship.  Our analysis shows that in reality, you&rsquo;d have to double that margin of error to plus or <b>minus</b> <b>6%</b> to <b>get</b> <b>95%</b> accuracy. That means that the outcome is less certain; the candidate is likely to get anywhere from 48% to 60% of the vote. </p>        <p>J k election results live. New york election results.
