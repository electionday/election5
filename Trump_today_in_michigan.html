        <h2><strong>Trump today in michigan Trump leaving gif</strong></h2>
        <p>Viral social media posts wrongly suggest that President Donald Trump&rsquo;s <b>three</b> eldest children are citizens only because of birthright citizenship.  <b>Donald</b> <b>Trump</b>, his third <b>wife</b> Melania, and their son Barron <b>were</b> the first family for the duration of his presidency. <b>Trump</b>&#39;s father Fred was the son of German <b>immigrants</b>, while his mother Mary Anne MacLeod was a Scottish immigrant. <b>Trump</b> has five children from three <b>wives</b>, and ten grandchildren.

(His middle wife, Maples, comes from...  His mother, Mary Anne Trump, nee Macleod, emigrated from the Scottish Isle of Lewis at age 18, and two of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s <b>three</b> wives were born overseas. In the interview, he even mistakenly said his...  <b>Donald</b> <b>Trump</b> has been married to Ivana <b>Trump</b>, Marla Maples and Melania Trump.
