        <h2><strong>What time is the last presidential debate Election polls whos leading</strong></h2>
        <p>The hearing detailed what former President <b>Donald</b> <b>Trump</b> <b>did</b> and <b>did</b> not <b>do</b> in the hours after his Ellipse speech and before he tweeted a video asking his supporters to leave the Capitol.  The statistics for the entirety of <b>Donald</b> <b>Trump</b>&rsquo;s time in office are nearly all compiled. As we did for his predecessor four years ago, we present a final look at the numbers.  <b>Donald</b> John <b>Trump</b> (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. <b>Trump</b> received a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968.  Trump and his allies repeatedly urged top Justice Department officials to help them overturn the results &ndash; and <b>Trump</b> nearly fired the acting attorney general who refused to do his bidding.  Three years later, and as we begin an election year where <b>Donald</b> <b>Trump</b> is the clear frontrunner for Republican nomination, we revisit the events of that day &mdash; and exactly what happened when.  As president, <b>Donald</b> <b>Trump</b> had a mixed record in keeping his promises. Since Trump&rsquo;s inauguration in 2017, PolitiFact has tracked 102 pledges Trump made to voters during the 2016 campaign. As...  Donald <b>Trump</b>&#39;s four-year tenure in the White House revealed extraordinary fissures in American society but left little doubt that he is a figure unlike any other in the nation&rsquo;s history.  The federal indictment of Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election came soon after similar election interference charges were made public against a <b>Trump</b> ally in Michigan.  <b>Donald</b> J. <b>Trump</b> was the 45th U.S. president. He was elected in November 2016 and served until January 2021. Previously, he was a real estate developer and reality television star. </p>        <p>Va register to vote deadline.
