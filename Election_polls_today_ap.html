        <h2><strong>Election polls today ap What happens on presidential election day</strong></h2>
        <p>Presidential elections were held in Ukraine on 31 October 1999, with a second round on 14 November. The result was a victory <b>for</b> <b>Leonid</b> <b>Kuchma</b>, who defeated Petro Symonenko in the run-off, winning a second consecutive presidential election.  In the last <b>election</b> President KUCHMA received 51.24% of the vote, thereby defeating Leonid KRAVCHUK, who received 45.06% of the vote. Population and number of registered voters: Population: 49,811,174 (July 1999 est.)  According to preliminary results from the Central Election Commission, incumbent <b>President</b> <b>Leonid</b> <b>Kuchma</b> won the election with over 56 percent of the vote. His challenger, Communist party head Petro Symonyenko, finished with roughly 38 percent of the vote.  <b>Ukraine</b>, Presidential Election, 31 October and 14 November 1999: <b>Final</b> <b>Report</b>. <b>Publisher</b>. Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Date. 7 March 2000. English.  1999 <b>Ukraine</b> Presidential <b>Election</b> Observation Mission Report October 31, 1999 and November 14, 1999 International Republican Institute 1212 New York Avenue, N.W., Suite 900  The Law on <b>Elections</b> of the President of <b>Ukraine</b> was adopted on 25 March 1999 and amended on 8 September 1999. Despite significant improvements, drawbacks remain. The Presidential Election Law and the Law on the Central Election Commission have increased transparency.  The 1999 Ukrainian presidential <b>election</b> took place during a period of extreme political turmoil. The excitement of democracy had waned, the economy spiraled ever downward, and charges of corruption among the administration seemed the harbinger of communist victory.  Ukrainian presidential <b>elections</b> determine who will serve as the President of <b>Ukraine</b> for the next five years. [1] Since the establishment of the position of the President of <b>Ukraine</b> in 1991, the presidential <b>elections</b> have taken place seven times: in 1991, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2010, 2014 and 2019.  <b>Ukraine</b>&#39;<b>s</b> Presidential Elections - 1999 On November 14, President Leonid Kuchma was re-elected for another 5-years term as President of Ukraine, beating Communist Party candidate Petro Symonenko, with 56.3 percent of the votes to Symonenko&rsquo;s 37.8 percent. </p>        <p>Next presidential debate schedule 2024. <a href="./671.html">Durham voting dates</a>. <b>Election polls today ap</b>.
