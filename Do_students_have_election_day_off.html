        <p>October 21, 2024.

The <b>U.S</b>. norm of voting on a Tuesday in <b>November</b> dates back to 1845 and is thanks to farmers. The big picture: <b>U.S</b>. voting these days isn&#39;t confined to just <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b>, but results aren&#39;t shared on a rolling basis as was the case before the mid-19th century.

For decades, federal elections in the United States have been held on the Tuesday after the first <b>Monday</b> in <b>November</b>. Why this date? Originally, election days varied by state, but in 1845 a law was passed to set a single election day for the entire country.  <b>Election</b> <b>Day</b> in the United States of America is the Tuesday following the first Monday in <b>November</b>. It can fall on or between <b>November</b> 2 and <b>November</b> 8. It is the <b>day</b> when popular ballots are held to select public officials.
